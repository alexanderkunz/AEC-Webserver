# AEC-Webserver
Minimalistic Python Webserver for listening of the serial communication of some devices from [AEConversion](www.aeconversion.de). It also contains a small library for parsing the serial data. It is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi but might also work on other devices or operating systems other than linux.

**Requires**
* [Bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

These dependencies might already be in the package index of Raspbian. To start the server, simply execute the webserver python code file.
